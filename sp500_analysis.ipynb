    "# S&P 500 Analysis\n",
    "By Justin Kim\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The S&P 500 is a stock market index comprised of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Not only is it widely regarded as a reliable long-term investment option, but it also serves as a key indicator of the U.S. economyâ€™s health. By tracking the performance of 500 leading companies, it provides valuable insights into economic trends and market conditions. In this project, I aim to reveal such insights by using data analysis techniques in Python."
